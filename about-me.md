# About Me

Hello, I am Noah Jorgensen, a Computer Science graduate from the University of New Haven. I have a plethora of knowledge when it comes to programming and team building. I founded the University of New Haven Computer Programming Club, and have attended a variety of collegiate programming competitions.

On my github you will see a few repositories:
- "UNH" which contains two pieces of software I wrote during my internship. One is in python, the other is a WPF app in C#/XAML.
- "Centennial Robot" which contains code for my senior design project. This is primarily some groundwork for vocal recognition, conversational agent, and vocal synthesis intengration written in python. There is also come facial recogniton in python as well.
- A third repositiory for a generic Discord bot written in java utilizing their JD-API (JDA).
