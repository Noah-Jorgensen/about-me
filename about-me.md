# About Me

Hello, I’m Noah Jorgensen. I’m a Computer Science student at the University of New Haven. 
When I'm not busy with classes and programming, I'm usually expanding and enjoying my large collection of music.
In addition to being a developer, I also have a strong background in Information Technology and helping solve 
computer-related problems.

If you would like to get in contact with me, feel free to send me an email at: **noahjorgensen.info@gmail.com**
